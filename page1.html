          <p>
            I was a cheerleader for 15 years of my life. I used to
            be a Siena College cheerleader, but I did not try out for
            the team this year.
          </p>

          My name is Megan Bayer and I am a senior Computer Science
          major at Siena College. I am 21 years old and I grew up in the
          town Middletown, NY. My home town is about 2 hours away from Siena.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have three brothers and no sisters. My brothers names are Joe,
          Michael, and Will. I also have a dog named Sammy and a cat named
          Gizmo. The cat and dog are basically the same size so they fight
          a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          After college, I want to return home and enter the work force.
          I may go into information technology to start, but I know that
          eventually I want to return to school to get my PhD in computer
          science. I like the idea of one day being a college professor.
